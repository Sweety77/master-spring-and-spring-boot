introduced in JDK 16 - Eliminating verbosity while creating Java Beans.
“Verbosity refers to the amount of boilerplate code required to define a Java Bean.

Java records are immutable data classes introduced in Java 16 that reduce boilerplate by automatically generating constructors,
accessors, and common methods like equals, hashCode, and toString

Java 16 records significantly reduce verbosity by automatically generating constructors, accessors, and common methods
    like equals, hashCode, and toString.”
    we can have custom methods in records as well

    Java Records (Java 16+)
    Example
    public record Person(String name, int age) {}

  automatically Get -

  1. private final fields

  2. Constructor

  3. Getters → name(), age()

  4. equals(), hashCode(), toString()

  Key characteristics

  1. Immutable by default

  2. Part of Java language

  3. No external dependency

  4. Very explicit intent: data carrier


When should you use Records?
  Best use cases
    DTOs (API request/response objects)
    Read-only data models
    Value objects
    Kafka / messaging payloads
    REST controllers (request/response)
    Config snapshots

 public record UserResponse(Long id, String email) {}

 “Records are ideal for immutable DTOs where the object represents data rather than behavior.”

 Examle JPA Entity-
 @Entity
 @Data
 @NoArgsConstructor
 @AllArgsConstructor
 public class User {
     @Id
     private Long id;
     private String email;
 }


⚠️ Important
    JPA + records ❌ (not officially supported / tricky)
    Lombok works very well with JPA


Real-world recommendation (very important)
    Modern Java backend projects:
        Records → DTOs, API models, Kafka messages
        Lombok → Entities, domain models, mutable objects


Example Architecture -

Controller  → Record (Request DTO)
Service     → Lombok / normal class
Repository  → JPA Entity (Lombok)
Response    → Record (Response DTO)



Java records are a language-level feature introduced in Java 16 to reduce verbosity for immutable data carriers.
Lombok is a compile-time code generation library that works across Java versions and supports both mutable and immutable models.
Records are best for DTOs and value objects, while Lombok is better suited for entities and mutable domain models.
