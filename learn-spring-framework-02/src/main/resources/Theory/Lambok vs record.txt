Java records are a language-level feature introduced in Java 16 to reduce verbosity for immutable data carriers.
Lombok is a compile-time code generation library that works across Java versions and supports both mutable and immutable models.
Records are best for DTOs and value objects, while Lombok is better suited for entities and mutable domain models.

Important-
JPA + records (not officially supported / tricky)
Lombok works very well with JPA

6 > Why records are NOT a Lombok replacement

Records:

- Cannot be mutable
- Cannot extend classes
- Not suitable for JPA entities

Lombok:

    More flexible
    Works everywhere
    Adds dependency + magic code generation

7. Real-world recommendation (very important)
Modern Java backend projects:

Records → DTOs, API models, Kafka messages

Lombok → Entities, domain models, mutable objects

Example architecture
Controller  → Record (Request DTO)
Service     → Lombok / normal class
Repository  → JPA Entity (Lombok)
Response    → Record (Response DTO)
